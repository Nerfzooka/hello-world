# hello-world
The result of following github's "Hello World" tutorial.
I love tutorials, I got a BitBucket account following a tutorial. Then I see github is mentioned in news articles about programming. This is my first day learning github.

This is my second try at github, many years after the first.  I would like to verify a github repository with the programmers signature.  I'm not having any luck, just bouncing around the git and github tabs that go nowhere and show nothing.
